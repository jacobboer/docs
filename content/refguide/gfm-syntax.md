Several places in published REST services indicate that you can use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for rich text.

This is especially useful in case you want to include JSON example payload in your rest documentation. Just add json and three backticks ```.
``` 
json 
[{ "Name": "My Name", 
"DateOfBirth": "2019-06-03T00:30:00", 
"Age": 18 }] 
``` 

For more information, see the [GitHub Guide to Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown).
