Several places in published REST services indicate that you can use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for rich text.

This is especially useful in case you want to include JSON example payload in your rest documentation. Just add three backticks, `json`, the JSON structure, and three backticks to close the code, as illustrated in this example:

```json
[{
"Name":"My Name",
"DateOfBirth": "2001-11-15",
"Age": 17
}]
```
